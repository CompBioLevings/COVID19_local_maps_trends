# COVID19_local_maps_trends
This is an RMarkdown script/document I created that will auto-download data from multiple sources, do some calculations and generate plots showing the COVID19 trends both nation-wide and for local states/counties over the past two weeks.  Specifically, it generates maps showing COVID death and case rates for the United States and for MN and WI, and dot plots with trendlines showing how COVID case rates are changing locally.  This is all output to an HTML file for easy viewing.
